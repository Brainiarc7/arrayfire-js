/* The role of this class is not to serve as a syntactic sugar for a mutex.
 * There should be no held mutexes in the application, because if a long running operation
 * holds a mutex in the background, and another lockable operation gets invoked in the main loop,
 * then it will hold the loop until the asynchronous operation gets completed. We will loose asynchronity.
 *
 * But there should be no ArrayFire operations run in parallel, because those are not thread safe.
 * It's the applications responsibility to provide sequentiality. This Guard class is there to enforce this rule.
 * If the application executes an ArrayFire operation while there is an already running asynchronous operation in progress,
 * an exception gets thrown.
